I’ve usually been held back by my uncertainty over why someone would ever want to read a technical blog by me: although I know plenty of things, I hardly have in-depth knowledge about anything, so I’ve always figured that there were people who were better at writing these things. There are already so many blogs out there, and I often feel that I don’t really want to add to the Huge Mess.\nBut I somehow managed to sign myself up at work to make blog posts, so now I’ve got to do something. Now, at work, I’m probably going to be writing about machine learning basics, and that’s hardly a topic lacking on the Internet. But—I suppose, the one thing I do know a fair bit about is chemistry, since that’s what I’ve spent 8 years of my life studying. I post a lot about chemistry elsewhere, and on several occasions (in real life) I’ve had people tell me that they found my writeups useful.\nSo, maybe I’ll intersperse my less-useful posts with some half-useful posts about chemistry…? And even if nobody reads it, this is probably useful for myself anyway!"

I did my PhD at Oxford in chemistry, specifically NMR spectroscopy: you might know me from some of the stuff that I’ve done there, such as the GENESIS website for NOAH supersequences.\nI’m not entirely sure why you, the reader, would be interested in what I have to write. I’m hardly an expert on anything (except, perhaps, my PhD area—but I’ve written enough about it), and there are many people whose opinions matter more. But, hey, why not, I guess.\nI’m not on social media much anymore, so there’s just a solitary link to my GitHub profile."
