You're starting a PhD or undergrad project on NMR spectroscopy, and you're going to be writing your own pulse sequences... which is great!
This series of posts aims to be a gentle introduction to constructing and running pulse programmes, which is complementary to TopSpin's reference manual.

# A little bit of history

These posts were in fact written in 2021, when I was doing my PhD at Oxford.
I have, however, set the post date to 2023 so that it doesn't appear at the bottom of my blog.
These used to be hosted on the Foroozandeh group blog, but I've since migrated them over to my own blog.

They are *not* complete in any way!
When I wrote these, I had really intended to cover quite a lot of material, especially 2D NMR, which was a huge part of my PhD work.
However, time got in the way, and I now no longer have access to NMR spectrometers since I've graduated.
